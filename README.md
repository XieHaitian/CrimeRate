# CrimeRate
A simple linear regression model with Python.

This repository is mainly used in get familiar with GitHub. I usually write Python codes on Jupyter Notebook. But putting .ipynb files on GitHub is not desired since you have to go inside the html if you want change the code. So it's better to download the .ipynb file from Jupyter as a .py file, and then upload.

The text file is from the Linear Regression Models course in Columbia University. Unfortunately, I forgot what 'x' and 'y' stands for. But it doesn't matter for I am only using it as a "Hello World" experiment for both Jupyter and GitHub.

Enjoy!
